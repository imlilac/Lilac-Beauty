## The Challenge

# React State Management Exercise

This project demonstrates basic state management in React through two simple components:

1. **Temperature Component**: This component displays the current temperature and allows you to increase or decrease it using buttons. The temperature value updates dynamically, and the background color changes based on the temperature range.

    - **State**: 
      - `temp`: Stores the current temperature (initialized to 10℃).
      - `tempClass`: Determines the CSS class based on the temperature to apply the appropriate background color (either "cold" or "hot").

    - **Methods**:
      - `addHandler()`: Increases the temperature by 1 degree up to a maximum of 30℃. Changes the temperature class if it reaches or exceeds 15℃.
      - `minHandler()`: Decreases the temperature by 1 degree down to a minimum of 0℃. Changes the temperature class if it falls below 15℃.

2. **Counter Component**: This component displays a counter value and provides buttons to increment or decrement the count.

    - **State**:
      - `count`: Tracks the current counter value (initialized to 0).

    - **Methods**:
      - `addHandler()`: Increases the counter value by 1.
      - `minHandler()`: Decreases the counter value by 1.

Both components use React class components and local state management to handle their respective functionalities. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a responsive and modern UI.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-beauty-react.git
   npm install
   npm start
```
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
